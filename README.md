# SW-Scene-Recreation
A personal project to recreate a scene from Empire Strikes Back, utlising Unity Tools

This is an ongoing project to recreate the Luke and Vader duel from ESB as a still in Unity. 
The scene will be updated as I learn more, and eventually I hope it to be as "photo-realistic" as Unity will allow (Unreal doesn't run on my current machine unfortunately)
